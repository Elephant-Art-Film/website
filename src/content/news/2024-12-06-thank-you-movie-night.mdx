A heartfelt THANK YOU to everyone who joined us on November 29th for ELEPHANT Art Film Production's special movie night. Your presence made the evening magical as we celebrated the art of storytelling with screenings of  Voyeuress, Cold Blue, and Resurfacing.

Whether it was the shared laughs, the deep discussions, or the quiet moments of reflection, you helped create a night to remember.  

Thank you for being part of our journey and for celebrating independent filmmaking with us. We look forward to welcoming you to future screenings and sharing more stories with you.

Sincerely,

The ELEPHANT Team
