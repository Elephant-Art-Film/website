We are proud to share that our short film Lev Berger premiered at the Festival neodvisnega filma 2025 and received a Special Mention from the festival.

The film was honored for its bold take on the cost of truth in today’s world, following a TV reporter and sound technician as they navigate the political-media maze.

As the jury noted:

“Precise. Without excess. Visually refined, rhythmically sharp. Mature acting. A small film — with a big theme. In the spirit of cinematic tradition, where doubt triumphs over certainty.”

Thank you to the FNF team, the jury, and everyone who supported us.

Congratulations to the amazing Lev Berger cast and crew, and to all fellow filmmakers at the festival.
