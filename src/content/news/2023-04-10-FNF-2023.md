ELEPHANT art film production is proud to announce that two of our short films, Klara's Dance and The Disappearance of Evelin Gale, have been selected to be screened at Festival neodvisnega filma 2023. We are excited to have the opportunity to share these two compelling films with audiences at the festival.

Klara's Dance is a story about a student Klara who gets distressed at an unexpected news, but keeps it a secret from her boyfriend thereby risking their relationship.

The Disappearance of Evelin Gale is a film that tells the story of David, a man who is facing a crisis in his current relationship. When he receives a phone call about his ex-girlfriend, David is forced to confront his past decisions.

We are honored to have the opportunity to showcase our work alongside other talented filmmakers at Festival neodvisnega filma Slovenije 2023. We hope that our films will move and inspire audiences, and we look forward to sharing them with you.
