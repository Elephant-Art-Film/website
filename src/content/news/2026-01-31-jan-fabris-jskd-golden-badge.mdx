Slovenian filmmaker Jan Fabris has received the Golden Badge of JSKD, awarded by the Republic of Slovenia Public Fund for Cultural Activities (JSKD), in recognition of his outstanding contribution to independent film production.

The award was formally presented on 31 January 2026 at Cankarjev dom in Ljubljana. In its citation, the professional jury emphasized that Jan Fabris, through independent production, consistently demonstrates strong creative potential and international competitiveness within non-institutional film. His work enriches Slovenian film culture, actively supports the development of younger filmmakers, and contributes to the wider recognition of independent film in Slovenia and abroad.

At the same ceremony, JSKD presented its highest lifetime achievement award, the Gold Plaquette, to Mitja Gobec, while Silver Plaquettes were awarded to Maja Gal Štromar, Miro Saje, Barbara Kovačič, and the Piuramaura Collective for their significant contributions to Slovenia’s cultural landscape. The event included keynote addresses by Mojca Jan Zoran, Director of JSKD, and Asta Vrečko, Minister of Culture of the Republic of Slovenia.

Independent film has long provided the natural framework for non-mainstream and non-institutional filmmaking in Slovenia, as reflected in platforms such as the Festival of Independent Film, which affirms the artistic relevance and professional standards of this field.

On behalf of ELEPHANT art film production, we extend our warmest congratulations to Jan Fabris on this important recognition. We are extremely proud to be part of his creative journey and honoured to support a filmmaker whose work continues to shape and strengthen independent film in Slovenia and beyond.
