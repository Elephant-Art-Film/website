We’re proud to announce that Jan Fabris, co-founder and core member of ELEPHANT Art Film Production, has been named one of Top Shorts’ 30 Exceptional Filmmakers to Watch in 2025.

Jan’s creative journey began early. In 1999, his passion for cinema and film history began to take shape. Over the years, he has written and directed a range of short fiction films that have screened and won awards at festivals worldwide.

In 2019, Jan co-founded ELEPHANT Art Film Production with fellow filmmakers and enthusiasts. As ELEPHANT, we’re proud that his creative path has been recognized. We look forward to sharing more art house films in the future.
