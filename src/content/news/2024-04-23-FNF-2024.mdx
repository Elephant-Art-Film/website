We are deeply grateful to everyone who attended the premiere of Voyeuress and Cold Blue at the Festival neodvisnega filma Slovenije 2024. Our heartfelt thanks go to the organisers of the festival, who not only hosted this extraordinary event, but also selected our films. It was an honour to screen our works in front of a full house and we greatly appreciate this opportunity. We would also like to thank the audience who supported independent cinema by coming to see our films. Your enthusiasm and support are invaluable and we hope you enjoyed the stories as much as we enjoyed sharing them with you. Once again, thanks to Festival neodvisnega filma 2024 and all the wonderful attendees for creating an unforgettable experience with us.
