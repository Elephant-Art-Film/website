Our heartfelt thanks go to Festival neodvisnega filma 2024, which not only organised this remarkable event, but also selected our films Voyeuress and Cold Blue. It was an honour to screen our works in front of a full house and we greatly appreciate this opportunity. Our thanks also go to the audiences who supported independent cinema by watching our films. Your encouragement and enthusiasm are invaluable to us, and we hope you enjoyed our stories as much as we enjoyed sharing them with you. Once again, we would like to thank Festival neodvisnega filma 2024 and all the wonderful attendees for creating an unforgettable experience with us.
