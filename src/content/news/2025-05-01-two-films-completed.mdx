We are pleased to announce the successful completion of production on two new films.

We're happy to share that Irena Zugic has completed her first film with our production team. It's been great working with Irena as she brought her vision to the screen, and we're excited to see where her filmmaking takes her next.

Under the direction of Jan Fabris, we've also wrapped production on his latest work.

We would like to thank both directors, along with all the cast and crew who worked on these projects. Everyone's hard work and dedication made these two films possible, and we appreciate being part of these collaborations.

Both films are now moving into post-production. We're looking forward to sharing these stories once they're ready and will keep you updated on their progress.

We are grateful for your ongoing support and look forward to sharing more soon.
